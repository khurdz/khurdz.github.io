## Embedding Security on your Terraform and Cloudformation code

* Got fond of [@PicardTips](https://twitter.com/picardtips) :D
* "Infrastructure as code (IaC) presents a new risk and a new opportunity"
* Nice tools :
  * [Checkov](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov) : static code analysis tool for infrastructure-as-code
  * [TerraGoat](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/terragoat) : vulnerable Terraform Infrastructure spawned for learning and training purpose
  * [CfnGoat](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/cfngoat) : same for CloudFormation
  * [Kubernetes-Goat](https://github.com/madhuakula/kubernetes-goat) : same for k8s
* DevSecOps utopia ? It's a world where :
  * Infrastructure is developed and secured in the same place
  * Issues are automatically prevented from being deployed
  * Security is a business enabler rather than a hindrance

* "Security touches everything"
