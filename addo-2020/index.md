## Notes

* Throughout the keynotes and sessions, a lot of reminders about DevOps basic principles (culture & automation)
* Back to basics instead of over-focusing on Cloud, SaaS, tools...
* Focus on people first (culture & training), then adapt your processes, and afterwards work on tools/technology/solutions, not the other way around
